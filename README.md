# Skill-Gap-Analysis-Tool

Project Overview
This project implements skill matching and gap analysis between interns and industry job roles using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

Features
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts intern and job skill sets into numerical vectors.
KMeans Clustering: Groups similar skill sets across interns and jobs.
Cosine Similarity: Measures alignment between intern profiles and job requirements.
Skill Gap Report: Identifies missing skills for each intern’s best-matched role.
Visualization: Bar chart showing match scores per intern.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy
scikit-learn (TF-IDF, KMeans, Cosine Similarity)
Matplotlib

Outcome
Best job match for each intern with a similarity score (0–1).
Insights into skills to improve for career readiness.
A scalable framework for AI-driven HRTech applications.
